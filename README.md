RTL2GDS Flow – My Submissions  This repository documents my journey of taking digital designs from RTL (Register Transfer Level) all the way to GDSII layout using the open-source VLSI toolchain. It is structured as a week-by-week set of submissions, experiments, and progress logs, inspired by the open-source silicon community’s learning practices.
📅 Week 0 — Setup & Tools
Task	Description	Status
Task 0	🛠️ Tools Installation — Installed Iverilog, Yosys, and gtkWave	✅ Done
🌟 Key Learnings from Week 0
Installed and verified open-source EDA tools successfully.
Learned about basic environment setup for RTL design and synthesis.
Prepared the system for upcoming RTL → GDSII flow experiments.
🙏 Acknowledgment
I am thankful to Kunal Ghosh and Team VLSI System Design (VSD) for the opportunity to participate in the ongoing RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program.

I also acknowledge the support of RISC-V International, India Semiconductor Mission (ISM), VLSI Society of India (VSI), and Efabless for making this initiative possible.
