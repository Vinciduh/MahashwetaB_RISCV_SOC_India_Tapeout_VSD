RTL2GDS Flow – My Submissions  This repository documents my journey of taking digital designs from RTL (Register Transfer Level) all the way to GDSII layout using the open-source VLSI toolchain. It is structured as a week-by-week set of submissions, experiments, and progress logs, inspired by the open-source silicon community’s learning practices.
This is a great starting point for your README. To make it professional, engaging, and structured like the example, I'll provide you with the full Markdown text.

You should copy and paste the entire block below into your `README.md` file and replace the placeholder content (e.g., `<Week 1 Task Description>`) with your actual progress.

# 🖥️ RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program VSD

Welcome to my journey through the **RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program VSD!**

This repository documents my **week-by-week progress** with tasks, key learnings, and final outcomes.

> "In this program, we learn to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL to GDSII using open-source tools. Part of India’s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, empowering 3500+ participants to build silicon and advance the nation’s semiconductor ecosystem."
