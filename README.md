RTL2GDS Flow – My Submissions  This repository documents my journey of taking digital designs from RTL (Register Transfer Level) all the way to GDSII layout using the open-source VLSI toolchain. It is structured as a week-by-week set of submissions, experiments, and progress logs, inspired by the open-source silicon community’s learning practices.

# 🖥️ RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program VSD

Welcome to my journey through the **RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program VSD!**

This repository documents my **week-by-week progress** with tasks, key learnings, and final outcomes.

> "In this program, we learn to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL to GDSII using open-source tools. Part of India’s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, empowering 3500+ participants to build silicon and advance the nation’s semiconductor ecosystem."

## 📅 Week 0 — Setup & Tools

| Task | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Task 0** | 🛠️ **Tools Installation** — Installed `Icarus Verilog` (Iverilog), `Yosys`, and `gtkWave` | ✅ **Done** |

### 🌟 Key Learnings from Week 0

* Installed and verified **open-source EDA tools** successfully.
* Learned about the **basic environment setup** for RTL design and synthesis.
* Prepared the system for upcoming **RTL → GDSII flow** experiments.
