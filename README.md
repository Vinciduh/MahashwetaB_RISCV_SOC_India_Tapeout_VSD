RTL2GDS Flow – My Submissions  This repository documents my journey of taking digital designs from RTL (Register Transfer Level) all the way to GDSII layout using the open-source VLSI toolchain. It is structured as a week-by-week set of submissions, experiments, and progress logs, inspired by the open-source silicon community’s learning practices.
